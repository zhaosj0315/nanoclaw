# 🏗️ SITE-A COST-RECOVERY & SHARING PROPOSAL
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Priority:** URGENT

## 1. ⚠️ Financial Situation Room
- **Cost Overrun:** $4.2M (Projected by end of week).
- **Cause:** Concrete supply chain collapse. Recovery requires 24/7 double-shifting and Backup-B premium rates.
- **Goal:** Neutralize the deficit without halting construction.

## 2. 🤝 Proposed Cost-Sharing Matrix (40/30/30)
| Stakeholder | Share (%) | Amount ($) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FIFA Infrastructure Fund** | 40% | $1.68M | Unforeseen supply chain force majeure. |
| **State/Local Contingency** | 30% | $1.26M | Economic benefit of 2026 games justification. |
| **Construction Insurance** | 30% | $1.26M | Claim filed under "Business Interruption/Logistics Failure". |

## 3. 🐾 NanoClaw Strategic Recommendation
Immediate activation of the **"Sprint Mode Agreement"** with contractors to lock in current Backup-B rates before regional competition for concrete escalates further in Q2.
