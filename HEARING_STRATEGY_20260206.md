# 🏛️ PLATTE_COUNTY_HEARING_STRATEGY (2026-02-06)
**Subject:** Approval of $8 International Terminal Surcharge for World Cup Security

## 1. 🎯 Core Argument: "The Gateway Security Mandate"
- **Position:** Platte County is not just a county; it is the **Front Door** of the United States for the 2026 World Cup.
- **Problem:** A $1.2M budget gap exists. Failure to fill this will result in "Critical Failure" (processing delays > 45 mins).
- **Solution:** The $8 Surcharge. It is a user-fee model that protects local taxpayers by shifting costs to international visitors.

## 2. 📊 Key Evidence (NanoClaw Simulations)
- **Logistics Success Rate:** 92% (with surcharge) vs 25% (status quo).
- **Public Safety:** The Platte County Sheriff’s Office officially supports this to maintain "Heightened Security Posture."
- **Economic Impact:** $8 is negligible for travelers but critical for securing the $4.2M local infrastructure investment.

## 3. 🛡️ Rebuttal Points for "Short-Sighted" Criticism
- **Claim:** "It's a tax hike." -> **Fact:** It's a temporary service fee for a global event.
- **Claim:** "Residents will pay." -> **Fact:** Only applies to international arrivals/terminals at KCI.

## 4. 📝 Final Statement Outline
"We cannot afford to be the bottleneck of the World Cup. If KCI fails, Site-A fails, and the Missouri gateway closes. Approve the $8 surcharge to ensure the safety and speed our community and visitors deserve."
