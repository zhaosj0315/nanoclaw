# 🚨 TACTICAL ALERT: REDUNDANCY & LOGISTICS CRISIS (2026-02-06)

## 1. 🛑 CRITICAL: BACKUP SERVER OFFLINE (10.0.0.5)
- **Status:** Unreachable (Subnet Mismatch).
- **Impact:** All chat histories and vector DB snapshots are currently ONLY stored locally.
- **Action Required:** Immediate VPN tunnel re-establishment or manual routing fix on the base station.

## 2. 🏗️ SITE A LOGISTICS BOTTLENECK
- **Simulation Result:** 3-Shift mode consumes Batch #4459 faster than anticipated.
- **Risk:** Concrete shortage predicted for Feb 9, 23:00 (C-Shift).
- **Order:** Expedite Batch #4460 by 12 hours.

## 3. 🇨🇳 BEIJING TECH SYNC (MEGA-GPU ERA)
- **Insight:** National 'New Infra' standard (2026) mandates liquid cooling for clusters > 12KW.
- **Local Impact:** If we scale our local nodes to handle 'Smart Research' surge, we must audit thermal capacity.

## 🐾 NEXT STEP
- I will monitor the I-29 virtual checkpoints to ensure material priority.
- Awaiting instructions for 10.0.0.5 routing override.
