# 🆘 PLATTE COUNTY HEARING: PLAN B (EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY)
**Status:** INTERNAL ONLY | **Date:** 2026-02-06
**Objective:** Operational survival if the $8 Surcharge is rejected.

## 1. Tactical Retrenchment (0-24 Hours)
*   **Gate Shutdown:** Immediate 50% reduction in KCI-South Gate operations.
*   **AI Pivot:** Force-activation of "NanoClaw Virtual Checkpoint (VC)" logic. Shift from 40% to **75% automated screening**.
    *   *Risk:* 5-8% increase in screening error margin; acceptable under emergency conditions.
*   **Tiered Access:** Prioritize "Category Alpha" (Perishables/Medical) logistics only.

## 2. Infrastructure Rerouting
*   **Secondary Corridor:** Redirect all "Category Beta" (Construction materials) to the I-29 North detour.
*   **Site-A Buffer:** Increase on-site material storage from 3 days to 7 days to absorb the 180-min processing delays.

## 3. Political Counter-Move
*   **Transparency Blitz:** Release the "Logistics Collapse" chart to the press immediately after a "No" vote to frame the committee as responsible for the upcoming gridlock.
*   **Federal Appeal:** File for emergency DHS grant under "Critical Gateway Protection" status.

## 4. Projected Outcome (Plan B)
*   **Logistics Delay:** 45-60 mins (Optimized via AI) vs. 180 mins (Unmanaged).
*   **Security Cost:** -15% (Personnel reduction) but +10% (Tech maintenance).
