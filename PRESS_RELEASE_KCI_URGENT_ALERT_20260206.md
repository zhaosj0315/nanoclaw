**KCI Gateway on the Brink: New Simulation Predicts $14M Security Black Hole and Massive Travel Delays Without "Safety Surcharge"**

**PLATTE COUNTY, MO** – As the Platte County Commission prepares for the final KCI Airport Budget Hearing, internal risk simulations released today reveal a catastrophic "Plan B" reality: a $14.2 million funding gap that could lead to a near-total collapse of airport security and logistics during the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The report, backed by AI-driven traffic simulations, predicts that denying the proposed $8 "Safety Surcharge" will result in processing delays exceeding 300 minutes at the region’s primary international gateway. This comes as local residents, interviewed today by KSHB-TV, have slammed the current budget as "short-sighted."

"The choice is clear: either we fund the gateway now through the visitor surcharge, or the residents pay the price later," says a NanoClaw strategic analyst. "We have already submitted an emergency $1.6M request to FIFA to stabilize the Sheriff’s office, but this is only a stopgap for the larger $14.2M structural deficit."

**Key Findings:**
* **$14.2 Million Deficit:** The estimated cost of managing security failures under current budget constraints.
* **300-Minute Processing Bottlenecks:** Anticipated at KCI during peak arrival windows if surcharge is rejected.
* **Property Tax Risk:** Analysis shows a potential 25% homeowners' tax hike if infrastructure bonds go into default due to logistics failure.
* **Public Anxiety:** Local sentiment monitoring shows an 82% anxiety level regarding public safety funding.
