# SUBJECT: URGENT: Infrastructure Safety Supplement Request - Kansas City Host City (Site-A / KCI Logistics)

**To: FIFA World Cup 2026 Logistics Committee / Infrastructure Oversight**
**From: Kansas City Strategic Planning Team (Logistics Defense Unit)**
**Date: February 6, 2026**

Dear Officials,

As we approach the final hearing regarding local infrastructure surcharges today, our tactical simulations (NanoClaw V9.8) have identified a critical vulnerability in the World Cup logistics corridor. 

**The Risk:**
Without the projected local surcharge revenue, the security and logistics gap at the KCI South Gate will reach **$35,000,000**, resulting in an estimated **180-minute delay** for all Tier-1 supply chains.

**The Solution: Project "Virtual Guard"**
We are formally requesting an emergency supplement of **$1,600,000 USD** from the Infrastructure Emergency Fund. This allocation will be utilized to:
1.  **AI Integration**: Accelerate the deployment of AI-driven automated screening at Site-A from 40% to 75%.
2.  **Strategic Rerouting**: Establish the I-29 Secondary Corridor as a high-frequency automated transit line.

Attached to this request is the *Logistics Collapse Risk Analysis (20260206)*. Failure to bridge this funding gap will necessitate a "Plan B" shift, which, while maintaining security, will significantly increase operational stress on regional transit.

We require a preliminary response within 24 hours to align with our local legislative contingency window.

Best regards,

[KC Strategic Planning Team
