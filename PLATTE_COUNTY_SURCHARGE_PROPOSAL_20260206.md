# 🛡️ PROPOSAL: Platte County Secure Gateway Initiative
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**To:** Platte County Board of Commissioners / FIFA Local Organizing Committee
**From:** NanoClaw Infrastructure Intelligence Unit
**Subject:** Emergency Revenue Strategy to Bridge the $20M Security Funding Gap

## 1. Executive Summary
The deployment of the **Virtual Checkpoint (VC)** reduces the security funding gap but does not eliminate it. To prevent a logistics collapse (Wait Times > 60 mins) during the World Cup, we require an immediate infusion of **$12.5M - $15M**.
This proposal outlines a **"User-Pays"** model to fund the remaining physical security requirements without burdening local property tax payers.

## 2. Revenue Mechanisms
We propose a dual-layer surcharge targeting the influx of temporary visitors:

### A. The "Hospitality Security Fee" ($8/night)
*   **Target:** All Hotel, Motel, and Short-Term Rental (Airbnb/VRBO) bookings within Platte County.
*   **Rate:** **$8.00 per occupied room night**.
*   **Projected Volume:** ~1.1 Million room nights (30-day peak period).
*   **Est. Revenue:** **$8,800,000**

### B. The "KCI Gateway Access Fee" ($2.50/trip)
*   **Target:** All TNC (Uber/Lyft) and Commercial Shuttle trips entering/exiting KCI Airport zone.
*   **Rate:** **$2.50 per trip**.
*   **Projected Volume:** ~1.6 Million trips.
*   **Est. Revenue:** **$4,000,000**

## 3. Financial Impact Analysis
| Source | Projected Revenue | Gap Reduction | Residual Gap | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current State** | $0 | $0 | **$20.0M** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Hospitality Fee** | $8.8M | -$8.8M | $11.2M | 🟠 UNSTABLE |
| **+ Gateway Fee** | +$4.0M | -$12.8M | $7.2M | 🟡 MANAGEABLE |
| **+ VC Savings** | (Efficiency) | -$5.0M (Equiv.)| **$2.2M** | 🟢 SECURE |

## 4. Implementation Strategy
-   **Immediate:** Board approval required by **Feb 10, 2026**.
-   **Technology:** Fees collected automatically via booking platforms (Expedia, Airbnb) and Ride-share apps (API Integration).
-   **Allocation:** 100% of funds earmarked for **"FIFA Security & Traffic Control Operations"**.

## 5. Recommendation
**ADOPT IMMEDIATELY.** The combination of the **Virtual Checkpoint** (Efficiency) and the **Secure Gateway Initiative** (Funding) is the *only* viable path to keep I-29 traffic moving.
