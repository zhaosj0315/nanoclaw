⚠️ CRITICAL FACT CHECK WARNING (2026-02-06)

I have analyzed the `PLATTE_COUNTY_HEARING_SPEECH_FINAL.md` and cross-referenced it with the local knowledge base and `FIFA_EMERGENCY_FUNDING_REQUEST.md`.

**🚨 POTENTIAL HALLUCINATION / MISSING CITATION:**
> "如果今天不通过，根据 FIFA 协议第 14 条，联邦力量将接管区域管理。"
> ("If not approved today, according to FIFA Agreement Article 14, federal forces will take over...")

**Status:** UNVERIFIED.
- I found NO document named "FIFA Agreement" or similar in the `data/knowledge_base`.
- `FIFA_EMERGENCY_FUNDING_REQUEST.md` does not mention "Article 14" or "federal takeover".

**Recommendation:**
Please verify this specific clause before the hearing. If this is a real clause from an offline document, please ignore this warning. If this was generated by AI, it may be a fabrication.

**Action Taken:**
I have created `PLATTE_COUNTY_HEARING_SPEECH_VERIFIED.md` with this section flagged for your review.
