# NanoClaw Project Materials

## Project Overview
NanoClaw is a privacy-first, containerized AI assistant for macOS and Linux. It bridges the gap between powerful LLMs and secure local execution.

## Core Features
- **Security**: Commands execute in a Docker-based sandbox (agent-runner).
- **Interface**: Primary interaction via WhatsApp for ubiquitous access.
- **Memory**: Hierarchical memory structure (Global vs. Local) for personalized assistance.
- **Extensibility**: Modular skill system (Gmail, Voice, Social Media).

## Technical Architecture
- **Host**: Manages communications and container lifecycle.
- **Sandbox**: Isolated environment for tool execution and code running.
- **LLM**: Powered by Claude/Gemini via secure APIs.
